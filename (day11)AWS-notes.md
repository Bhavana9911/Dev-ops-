# 1️⃣ Basics of Networking

## 🔹 What is Networking?

Networking is the practice of connecting computers and devices to share data and resources.

In cloud computing, networking enables:
- Communication between servers
- Internet access
- Secure traffic routing
- Isolation of environments

---

## 🔹 Key Networking Components

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| IP Address | Unique identifier of a device |
| Subnet | Logical subdivision of network |
| Router | Routes traffic between networks |
| Switch | Connects devices in LAN |
| Gateway | Entry/Exit point of network |
| DNS | Resolves domain to IP |

---

## 🔹 Types of IP Addresses

### Public IP
- Accessible over internet
- Example: `3.110.20.15`

### Private IP
- Used inside private network
- Example ranges:
  - 10.0.0.0/8
  - 172.16.0.0/12
  - 192.168.0.0/16

---

## 🔹 OSI Model (Interview Favorite)

| Layer | Name | Example |
|-------|------|----------|
| 7 | Application | HTTP |
| 4 | Transport | TCP/UDP |
| 3 | Network | IP |
| 2 | Data Link | MAC |
| 1 | Physical | Cables |

---

## 🔹 TCP vs UDP

| Feature | TCP | UDP |
|----------|------|------|
| Reliable | ✅ | ❌ |
| Ordered | ✅ | ❌ |
| Fast | ❌ | ✅ |
| Example | HTTP | DNS |

---

## 🔹 Real-World Use Case

A web application:
1. User enters URL.
2. DNS resolves IP.
3. TCP connection established.
4. HTTP request sent.

---

# 2️⃣ CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

## 🔹 What is CIDR?

CIDR is a method for allocating IP addresses and routing.

Format:
```
IP_Address/Prefix
```

Example:
```
192.168.1.0/24
```

---

## 🔹 What Does /24 Mean?

- 24 bits for network
- Remaining bits for hosts
- Formula:

```
2^(32 - prefix) = total IPs
```

Example:
```
/24 → 2^(32-24) = 256 IPs
```

Usable:
```
256 - 2 = 254
```

---

## 🔹 CIDR Quick Table

| CIDR | Total IPs | Usable |
|------|------------|---------|
| /24 | 256 | 254 |
| /25 | 128 | 126 |
| /26 | 64 | 62 |
| /27 | 32 | 30 |
| /28 | 16 | 14 |

---

## 🔹 CIDR Interview Question

**Q:** Why subtract 2 usable IPs?  
👉 Network ID & Broadcast ID reserved.

---

# 3️⃣ Introduction to VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

## 🔹 What is VPC?

Amazon VPC is a logically isolated virtual network inside AWS where you launch resources.

Think of it as:
> Your private data center inside AWS.

---

## 🔹 VPC Core Components

- Subnet
- Route Table
- Internet Gateway
- NAT Gateway
- Security Groups
- NACL

---

## 🔹 Basic VPC Architecture

```
                 Internet
                     |
               Internet Gateway
                     |
         +--------------------------+
         |           VPC            |
         |   10.0.0.0/16            |
         |                          |
         |   Public Subnet          |
         |   10.0.1.0/24            |
         |        EC2               |
         |                          |
         |   Private Subnet         |
         |   10.0.2.0/24            |
         |        EC2               |
         +--------------------------+
```

---

## 🔹 Real-Time Use Case

- Public Subnet → Load Balancer
- Private Subnet → Application Server
- Database in Private Subnet

This is 3-tier architecture.

---

# 4️⃣ CIDR Calculation for Subnets

## 🔹 Scenario

VPC CIDR:
```
10.0.0.0/16
```

Need:
- 2 Public Subnets
- 2 Private Subnets

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Understand Available IPs

```
/16 → 2^(32-16) = 65,536 IPs
```

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Choose Subnet Size

If we choose:
```
/24
```

Each subnet:
```
256 IPs
```

---

## 🔹 Subnet Allocation Example

| Subnet | CIDR |
|----------|--------|
| Public-A | 10.0.1.0/24 |
| Public-B | 10.0.2.0/24 |
| Private-A | 10.0.3.0/24 |
| Private-B | 10.0.4.0/24 |

---

## 🔹 Interview Scenario

**Q:** If VPC is /16, can you create /15 subnet?  
👉 No. Subnet must be equal or smaller (higher prefix number).

---

# 5️⃣ Create VPC and Subnet (Step-by-Step)

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Create VPC (Console)

1. Go to VPC Dashboard
2. Click Create VPC
3. CIDR: `10.0.0.0/16`
4. Enable DNS support

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Create Subnets

- Public Subnet: `10.0.1.0/24`
- Private Subnet: `10.0.2.0/24`

Select different AZs.

---

## 🔹 Step 3: Attach Internet Gateway

1. Create IGW
2. Attach to VPC

---

## 🔹 Step 4: Create Route Table

Public Route:
```
0.0.0.0/0 → Internet Gateway
```

Associate with Public Subnet.

---

## 🔹 Step 5: Launch EC2

- Public EC2 → Auto assign public IP
- Private EC2 → No public IP

---

# 🛠 CLI Commands (Optional)

Create VPC:
```bash
aws ec2 create-vpc --cidr-block 10.0.0.0/16
```

Create Subnet:
```bash
aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id vpc-xxxx --cidr-block 10.0.1.0/24
```

# 🏁 Interview Answer Tip (Very Important)

For Networking & VPC questions:

1️⃣ Start with definition  
2️⃣ Explain working mechanism  
3️⃣ Give real-time example  
4️⃣ Mention security impact  
5️⃣ Add one limitation  

Example:

> "A VPC is a logically isolated network in AWS that allows us to define our own IP range using CIDR. It contains subnets, route tables, and gateways. In production, we use public subnets for load balancers and private subnets for applications to enhance security."
